# Data transformation with ``dplyr::``
<img src="pngs/dplyr_guide_for_one_table.png" width=400 height=283 align="right"/>

I created this alternative cheat sheet (or guide) for those who already know a little about __dplyr__. The point of this cheat is to help you figuring out quickly which verb, suffix and arguments to use.

As such the sheet complements and not substitute the official __dplyr__ cheat sheet available [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets).

This sheet to __dplyr__ has been created end of September 2019 using LibreOffice with the type faces _monaco_ for ``code``, _Nimbus Sans_ for the main text & _Source Sans Pro Light_ for the title.

Please file feedbacks or comments as issues.

Volunters who could turn this into a durable __LaTeX__ file are highly welcome (LibreOffice formating is too fragile for my taste, but the amount of __TikZ__ gymnastic required is a little daunting).
