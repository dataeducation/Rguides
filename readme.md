# Data transformation with ``dplyr::``

This guide to dplyr has been created in September 2019 using Libre Office with the type faces monaco for ``code``, Nimbus Sans for text & Source Sans Pro Light for the title.

Please leave feedbacks or comments as issues.

Volunters welcome to turn this into a durable LaTeX file (Libre Office formating is too fragile for my taste, but the amount of TikZ gymnastic required is a little daunting)
